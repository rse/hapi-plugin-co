Installation

```

About
-----

This is a small plugin for the [HAPI](http://hapijs.com/) server
framework for seamless support of co-routines for route handlers,
based on generator functions.

NOTICE
------

Although this plugin was ported to and works just with HAPI version
&gt;= 17.0.0 and Node.js version &gt; 8.0.0, you are advised to use
*asynchronous functions* with HAPI version &gt;= 17.0.0's native support
instead of *generator functions* and this HAPI plugin support. Generator
functions and this HAPI plugin are actually from the HAPI version &lt;
17.0.0 and Node.js version &lt; 8.0.0 era.

Usage
-----

The following sample server shows the plugin in action.
It responds with `{ value: 42 }` after waiting for a second.

```js
var HAPI    = require("hapi")
var HAPICo  = require("hapi-plugin-co")
var Request = require("request-promise")

var server = new HAPI.Server({ debug: { request: [ "error" ] } })
server.connection({ address: "127.0.0.1", port: 12345 })
server.register(HAPICo, function () {

    /*  provider  */
    server.route({
        method:  "GET",
        path:    "/foo",
        handler: function * (request, reply) {  /*  THE CO-ROUTINE  */
            var value = yield new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
                setTimeout(function () {
                    resolve(42)
                }, 1000)
            })
            reply({ value: value })
        }
    })

    server.start(function () {
        /*  consumer  */
        let p1 = server.inject({ method: "GET", url: "/foo" }).then(function (response) {
            if (response.result.value === 42)
                console.log("-- internal request: /foo: OK")
            else
                console.log("-- internal request: /foo: ERROR: invalid response: ", response.result.value)
        }).catch(function (error) {
            console.log("-- internal request: /foo: ERROR: ", error)
        })
        let p2 = Request({ uri: "http://127.0.0.1:12345/foo", json: true }).then(function (response) {
            if (response.value === 42)
                console.log("-- external request: /foo: OK")
            else
                console.log("-- external request: /foo: ERROR: invalid response: ", response.value)
        }).catch(function (error) {
            console.log("-- external request: /foo: ERROR: ", error)
        })
        Promise.all([ p1, p2 ]).then(function () {
            server.stop({ timeout: 1000 }, function (error) {
                if (error)
                    console.log("ERROR", error)
                process.exit(0)
            })
        })
    })

})
```

Notice
------

The smaller alternative: With
[`hapi-async-handler`](https://github.com/ide/hapi-async-handler)
there is an alternative HAPI plugin with similar functionality. The
difference is that `hapi-async-handler` uses the official HAPI `handler`
functionality to provide its functionality (and this way unfortunately
causes more boilerplate code for the application then wished), does not
recognize `Boom` error responses, requires an ES7 `async function ()`
(and not just an ES6 generator function `function * ()`) and especially
does not use `co` internally (and this way cannot easily support the
yielding of regular values, promises, sunks, etc).

The larger alternative: With
[`hapi-co`](https://github.com/bandwidthcom/co-hapi) there is
another alternative HAPI plugin with a much larger functionality. It
allows the use of `co`-powered generator functions for all types of
callbacks, including handlers. If you really need all this additional
functionality, go with this module instead.
